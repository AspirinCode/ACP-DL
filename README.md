ACP-DL: a deep learning long short-term memory model to predict anticancer peptides using high efficiency feature representation

Cancer is a well-known dreadful killer of human beings health, which has led to countless deaths and misery. Anticancer peptides open promising perspective for the cancer treatment and have various at-tractive advantages. Conventional hands-on methods are expensive and inefficient to find and identify novel anticancer peptides. This grim situation underlines the urgent need to develop novel efficient measures to predict novel anticancer peptides. In this study, we proposed a deep learning Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model, named ACP-DL, to effectively predict novel anticancer peptides. The efficient features exploited from peptides sequences are fed as input to train LSTM model. More specifically, to fully exploit protein se-quence information, we developed an efficient feature representation approach by integrating binary profile feature and improved conjoint triad feature. Then we implemented a deep LSTM model to auto-matically learn how to identify anticancer peptides and non-anticancer peptides. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the deep LSTM model has been applied to predict anticancer peptides. It was demonstrated by rigorous cross-validations that the proposed ACP-DL remarkably outperformed other comparison methods with 81.48% accuracy at the AUC of 0.894 on benchmark dataset ACP740 and with an accuracy of 85.42% at the specificity of 89.94% and the AUC of 0.906 on independent dataset ACP240, respectively. In addition, we also have contributed two novel anticancer peptides benchmark datasets ACP740 and ACP240 in this work.
